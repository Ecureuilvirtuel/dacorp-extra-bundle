Dacorp Extra Bundle
====================

Collection of services, helper, and standard view for standard services you want to use in any kind of website.

It's a **Work in Progress** mainly used for other project. You can browse the repository, but I would not recommend you to use it unless you know what you want ;)

Some of the feature included :

* Image Uploader Service : Integration of Punkave Image Uploader as a service tight to a generic Media Model
* Simple README functionality included by default on demand (usually dev environment only is fine) : give you a page with a html rendered version of the README.md Markdown file located in the root of your Project.


Using the ImageUploader Service:

include the default uploader
    {% include "DacorpExtraBundle:Common:file-upload-control.html.twig" %}
